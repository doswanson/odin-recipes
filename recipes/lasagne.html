        <li>8 oz. dry lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>15 oz. ricotta cheese</li>

        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese, plus 1/4 cup for the top</li>
        <li>1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>1 lb. fresh mozzarella, thinly sliced</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Saute onion in olive oil until softened. Add the garlic and saute until fragrent, approximately 30s. Add the sausage and cook until no longer pink.</li>
        <li>Add the crushed tomateos and tomato paste, half of the fresh parsley, all of the basil, the salt, and the pepper. Simmer uncovered for 15-20 minutes until thickened and reduced.</li>
        <li>Place the lasagne noodles in a rectangular baking dish. Cover with boiling water and leave to soak for 20 minutes. Use tongs to occasionally move the noodles around while the soak, lest they stick together. After the 20 minutes is up, remove the noodles from the water, and lay them out in a single layer. (The noodles might stick if they are touching or overlapping)</li>
        <li>Combine the ricotta, goat chees, parmesan, egg, and the rest of the parsley in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Use a whisk or spoon to combine everything.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Spread 1/3 of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 baking dish. Use 1/2 of the noodles to cover the sauce. Cover the noodles with 1/2 of the mozzeralla slices and 1/2 of the ricotta mixture. Cover the ricotta mixture with the remaining noodles, the rest of the mozzeralla slices, the rest of the ricotta mixture, the rest of the meat sauce. Finally, sprinkle 1/4 cup of Parmesan on top.</li>
        <li>Put the pan in the preheated oven (no need to cover) and bake for 30 minutes. If the noodles are tender, but it's not browning on top, use the broiler to brown the top. Let cool 15 minutes and serve.</li>
    </ol>
