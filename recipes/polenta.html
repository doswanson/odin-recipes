    <h2>Description:</h2>

    <p>Polenta is easy to make, but using an electric pressure cooker makes it so much easier.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>

        <li>1 cup polenta (not instant, I use Bob's Red Mill brand polenta)</li>
        <li>4 cups water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>black pepper</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>4 ounces finely grated parmesan (more for topping)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk polenta and water together in an electric pressure cooker. I use an Instant Pot. Season with the kosher salt and black pepper. Set the pressure cooker to "saute" mode, and bring the mixture to a simmer. Give it one final whisk, and hit cancel. Seal the pressure cooker and cook on high pressure for 9 minutes. Do a quick release, and whisk the polenta until smooth.</li>
        <li>Cut the unsalted butter into 8 pieces and stir the butter into the polenta until melted. Add the parmasan in several additions (4 to 6) whisking thouroughly after each addition.</li>
        <li>Season with additional salt and pepper, if needed.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a serving dish and sprinkle with additional parmesan.</li>
    </ol>
